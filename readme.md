# Project Description: Salary Prediction using Machine Learning Linear Regression

- The objective of this project is to build a model that predicts the salaries of employees based on their years of experience, and salary. The project will be implemented using machine learning linear regression techniques.

- The first step in the project will be to preprocess the data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and data transformation. The data will then be split into training and test sets.

- Next, linear regression algorithms will be applied to the training dataset to build a model. The model will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared value.

- The output of the project will be a machine learning model that can predict the salaries of employees based on years of experience. This model can be used by companies and human resources departments to make informed decisions regarding employee compensation and benefits.

- Overall, this project will showcase the use of machine learning linear regression techniques to solve real-world problems in the field of human resources and employee compensation.
